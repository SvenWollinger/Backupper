# Backupper
Simple backup script

To use you can download the [Creator.bat](https://github.com/SvenWollinger/Backupper/blob/master/Creator.bat), which will do everything for you.

If you want to look further into how it works we have two example .bat files on this repository.

Backupper requires 7zip to work properly, the 7zip path needs to be set directly in the Backupper.bat file.
