# Backupper
Simple backup script

To use check out the Example.bat file, simple copy it and change your values as needed.

You can select individual folders to be backed up, for that follow the MultiFileExample.bat file.

Backupper requires 7zip to work properly, the 7zip path needs to be set directly in the Backupper.bat file.
